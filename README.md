Welcome to the MyDog Virtual Assistant! This is a virtual assistant built by Osvaldo Sanchez, Nicholas Mueth, Joshua Toth, and Parfait Domagni. This project was built as a web app for our CS499 - Senior Seminar for our last semester at Southeast Missouri State University in 2020. Despite complications arising due to quarantine, through collaboration and hard work, we have successfully banded together to form a powerful education tool sure to assist any dog owner.

Disclaimer: This project is purely for educational and demonstration purposes, we are not doctors or licensed veterinary physicians. Please consult the proper care technicians if your dog is suffering from any serious health risks/conditions.
