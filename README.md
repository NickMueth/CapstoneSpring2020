<h1>Welcome to the MyDog Virtual Assistant!</h1>
This is the veterinarian virtual assistant built as a web app for our Senior Capstone Experience (CS499). This web app was written by Osvaldo Sanchez, Nicholas Mueth, Joshua Toth, and Parfait Domagni for our last semester at Southeast Missouri State University in 2020. Despite complications arising due to quarantine, through collaboration and hard work, we have successfully banded together to form a powerful education tool sure to assist any dog owner.
