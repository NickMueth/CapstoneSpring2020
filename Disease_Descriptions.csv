"Cushing disease, or pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism, arises from adenomatous enlargement of the pituitary gland, resulting in excessive ACTH production. A related term, Cushing syndrome, refers to elevated adrenocortical hormones, regardless of cause. The latter term includes pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism as well as adrenal-dependent disease, which is associated with functional adenomas or adenocarcinomas of the adrenal gland. Ectopic ACTH secretion has not been reported in dogs; however, in people, ectopic ACTH secretion is associated with certain lung tumors. Iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism results from chronic excessive exogenous steroid administration.","Unfortunetly this disease is hereditary, so there is not much to prevent the disease.",There is not much transmission for this disease. Cushing's disease is sometimes hereditary or can be developed and maintained to a certain degree.,"Three treatment options are available for Cushing disease in dogs. Medical, surgical, and radiation therapy have all been used with varying degrees of success.",https://nitrocdn.com/efuJsKtDyptHinJPkZsojPmTOBGlNDxZ/assets/static/optimized/rev-ce16c6e/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Cushings-01.jpeg,https://www.merckvetmanual.com/endocrine-system/the-pituitary-gland/cushing-disease-pituitary-dependent-hyperadrenocorticism-in-animals?network=g&matchtype=b&keyword=%2Bcushing%27s%20%2Bdisease%20%2Bdogs&creative=226412546850&device=c&devicemodel=&placement=&position=&campaignid=953310883&adgroupid=52924573128&loc_physical_ms=9022890&loc_interest_ms=&gclid=CjwKCAjw-YT1BRAFEiwAd2WRttBWxf47YXKdQOnigcOeaYNHBh5BCnokVZsxA55umVUD19Pv--1hBBoCU4kQAvD_BwE
"In hypothyroidism, impaired production and secretion of thyroid hormones result in a decreased metabolic rate. This disorder is most common in dogs but also develops rarely in other species, including cats, horses, and other large, domestic animals. Most common in dogs 4-10 years of age. Another thing is that spayed females have a higher risk of developing the disease.",Thyroid disease in dogs requires medical treatment from a veterinarian. Make an appointment with your veterinarian if your dog is showing symptoms of thyroid disease.,"The Merck Veterinary Manual states that hypothyroidism is one of the most over-diagnosed diseases in dogs. This is because many diseases mimic hypothyroidism. Some conditions or clinical signs even improve with thyroid medication. Other diseases also affect the thyroid levels, but are not hypothyroidism. This can make diagnosing a thyroid condition tricky, so be patient as you work with your veterinarian to get to the root of your dog’s symptoms.

Your veterinarian will diagnose your dog based on clinical signs and careful diagnostic testing. This will probably require several blood tests to determine if your dog exhibits any of the abnormalities commonly associated with the disease, and regular monitoring of your dog’s thyroid levels.

One of these tests will probably be a test of your dog’s T4 concentration. This is a good initial screening test for hypothyroidism, however, your veterinarian may recommend running further tests to get a definitive result.","Not much treatment for this disease, but it can beHypothyroidism is treatable. Your veterinarian will probably give your dog a prescription for thyroxine, a replacement hormone compound, to offset your dog’s low thyroid function.

The dosage will vary depending on your dog’s weight and thyroid levels. Your veterinarian may need to adjust your dog’s dosage over time, and you should expect to see results after one to two months. Once your veterinarian has determined a stable dose, your dog will most likely need to have his thyroid levels retested once or twice a year and continue the stable dose of medication, for the rest of his life. managed with daily thyroid hormone replacement.",https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/4c/db/c54cdb9981612f37e1d0c95557334068.jpg,https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/thyroid-disease-in-dogs/
"Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a disease of humans and dogs that is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. (Rickettsiae are a specialized type of bacteria that live only inside other cells.) The spotted-fever group of organisms is found worldwide, but the closely related organisms within this group that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever are only found in certain geographic areas of North, South, and Central America.","The most important preventive steps are those that control ticks, the most common source of the disease. Keeping your dog away from areas known to harbor ticks is a step you can take. Preventive medications that will keep your dog from being infested with ticks are also available from your veterinarian. Any ticks found on your dog should be promptly and properly removed to prevent the spread of disease. Remove any ticks by using fine-pointed tweezers to grasp the head of the tick (right where it enters the skin). Pull the tick straight off, making sure not to grasp or squeeze its body. If there are multiple ticks, it may be best to have your veterinarian remove them and examine your dog. It is important to remember that contact with fluids and excretions from infected ticks can spread the disease to people.","This disease is often transmitted through the bites of infected ticks. In the United States, the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick are considered the most important transmission agents for Rickettsia rickettsii. The brown dog tick also transmits the disease in some parts of the country (including Arizona) and in other countries.","There are treatment options available, if you believe this illness it what you are looking for please CONTACT YOUR VET

Von Willebrand's disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder of both humans and dogs. It is caused by a deficiency in the amount of a specific protein needed to help platelets (the blood cells used in clotting) stick together and form clots to seal broken blood vessels. The deficient protein is called von Willebrand factor (vWF).,The avoidance of certain medications is critical for the dog with known vWD. Please contact youi vet to find out what medications are on this list.,"This disease is developed when a dog has too few platelets, wounds and injuries can be really dangerous because he or she might not stop bleeding and lose a lot of excess blood.","In an emergency situation, transfusion of blood or fresh frozen plasma may stabilize a bleeding patient. The dog donating blood may be treated with a drug called DDAVP prior to blood collection. DDAVP will raise the level of von Willebrand factor in the donor's blood, an obvious benefit for the dog with vWD.

Some dogs with vWD are able to increase the amount of von Willebrand factor in circulation after the administration of DDAVP, although the response is variable. At this time, it is not recommended to use this drug on a regular basis. The drug is expensive, and not all dogs will respond to it. Your veterinarian will discuss the treatment option and help you decide if it is an appropriate option for your pet's condition.",https://vcahospitals.com/-/media/vca/images/lifelearn-images/vonwillebrand2018scaler.jpg?la=en&hash=2A101041CCE5F6AE2051BA2D677B4CA6,https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/von-willebrands-disease-in-dogs
"The heartworm in dogs that’s prevalent in the U.S. goes by the scientific name Dirofilaria immitis or D. immitis. It does not spread from dog to dog, but requires an intermediary, the mosquito, to infect new hosts.

The worms enter their host through a mosquito bite when it is taking a blood meal. Residue on the mosquito’s mouthpiece carries immature worms called microfilaria (which are only about 1/100th of an inch long) from an infected animal to an uninfected one. The immature worms travel through the bloodstream and, after about two months, settle in the right side of the heart, where they begin to grow.

They mature after six months and can live in the dog’s body for seven years, each reaching a length of up to one foot, and constantly producing offspring. After about a year, a dog may harbor hundreds of these worms, although 15 is the average burden. The worms cause inflammation and damage the heart, arteries, and lungs.","All dogs should be tested annually, even those on heartworm prevention medication year round.                                                                                          Puppies under seven months old may be started on heartworm prevention even though it can take six months or more for blood work to test positive. After that, they should be tested in six months and again, six months later. Puppies under seven months old may be started on heartworm prevention even though it can take six months or more for blood work to test positive. After that, they should be tested in six months and again, six months later. Dogs that have missed a treatment or for whom treatment has lapse need to be tested. If you’ve missed even one dose, or been late to administer, your dog should be tested",Heartworms are only transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.,"Confirm diagnosis: Treatment is expensive and complex, so your vet may want to perform additional tests to confirm the diagnosis.

Restrict activity: Although it may be difficult to restrict normal activity, especially in active dogs, this is crucial. Exertion will increase the rate of damage to the heart and lungs. Crate confinement may be necessary.

Stabilize the disease: If your dog has advanced symptoms or other medical conditions, preliminary therapies may be required.

Kill worms: The drug that is FDA-approved for treatment in the U.S., is melarsomine dihydrochloride, which is sold under the brand names Immiticide and Diroban.",https://www.vetwest.com.au/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/article/heartworm-cycle-in-dog.jpg,https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/heartworm-in-dogs-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/
