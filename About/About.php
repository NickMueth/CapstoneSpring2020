                Hello, my name is Osvaldo Sanchez, but most call me Ozzy. I'm a senior at Southeast Missouri State University and graduating this Spring with a Bachelors in Computer Information Systems.
                I wish to start as a Junior Developer working with OOP languages, like Java, work my way to Senior Developer, and ultimately work as a Project Manager.
                My contributions for this website were the initial designs of all pages, the creation of the Clicked Disease Pages and this page you're on right now!
                I also largely took on the role of organizing the team and working as the team leader. We sincerely thank you for looking at our project and hope you will reach out to us.

                Hello, my name is Nick Mueth. I'm a student at Southeast Missouri State University graduating with a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Web Programming.
                After I finish school, I am getting hired by a local family-owned convenience store chain called MotoMart, to fill a brand new position in their IT Department.
                In our Capstone project I worked mainly on the design of the site, and the backend functionality.
                This project was a fun one to work on, I learned a lot about dog health and writing PHP. I hope you enjoy the site and get good use out of it.

                    I want to work in a business analysis position to better serve business on what their data could do for them, or do explain to them what it could possibly mean.
                    Fir this project, I worked mainly with the Database as well as helping to plan out the early stages of the project.
                    Working with the data architecture is something that really set into motion what I have learned from my time here at Southeast.
